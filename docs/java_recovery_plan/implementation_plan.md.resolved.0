# Java Recovery Plan Setup

## Goal Description
Set up the directory structure and initial content for the "Java Recovery Plan" based on the user's previous consultation. The goal is to create a structured learning environment for weeks 1-3.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Access to Artifacts**: I cannot access the `book_memo` directory to copy the "Freelance Career Consultation" artifacts. Please provide the content or move the files to the current workspace.

## Proposed Changes

### Directory Structure
Create the following directories in `c:/Users/user/Dev/java-training-ground`:
- `week1`
- `week2`
- `week3`

### Content
- Populate the directories with the learning plan artifacts (once provided).

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Verify that directories `week1`, `week2`, and `week3` exist.
- Verify that the artifacts are correctly placed (once provided).
